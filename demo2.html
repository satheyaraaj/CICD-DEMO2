	<p>The Jenkins project was originally named Hudson, and was renamed in 2011 after a dispute with Oracle, which had forked the project and claimed rights to the project name. The Oracle fork, Hudson, continued to be developed for a time before being donated to the Eclipse Foundation. Oracle's Hudson is no longer maintained[6][7] and was announced as obsolete in February 2017.[8]

Around 2007 Hudson became known as a better alternative to Cruise Control and other open-source build-servers.[1][9] At the JavaOne conference in May 2008 the software won the Duke's Choice Award in the Developer Solutions category.[10]
